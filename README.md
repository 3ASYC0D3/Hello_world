# Hello_world

It's me DARIO! I'm a bit confused with my currnet job. I think I need to do something new in my life. I want to be less associted with place of work. In aviation it is impossible. I'm obligated to seat in maintenance hangar for whole days, form 7am to 7pm. It is annoying.  Ok... no more complaining. 
I have motivation to learn something new. I'm creative and positive person, so I'm sure I can develop new skills easliy. And that is what I will do now... Take a seat, fasten your belt and look how to do it XD
